Use stacked image.
Calculate the disparity at different levels in a residual mannar.
Refinement/Contextual use separate feature extractor.
Refinement is an encoder-decoder with skip connection.
Correlation larger radius (24).
BatchNomarlization.
Cost consists of comparable numbers of channels for correlation and feature.
Supervise the upscaled disparity.
Smallest level disparity goes through a leakyReLU(0.3).
